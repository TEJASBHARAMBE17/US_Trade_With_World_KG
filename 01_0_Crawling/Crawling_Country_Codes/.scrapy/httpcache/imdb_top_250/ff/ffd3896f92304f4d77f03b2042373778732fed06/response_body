          <p>
          <a href="/name/nm0000142">Clint Eastwood</a> was born May 31, 1930 in San Francisco, the son of Clinton Eastwood Sr., a bond salesman and later manufacturing executive for Georgia-Pacific Corporation, and <a href="/name/nm2503495">Ruth Wood</a> (née Margret Ruth Runner), a housewife turned IBM clerk. He had a comfortable, middle-class upbringing in nearby Piedmont. At school Clint took interest in music and mechanics, but was an otherwise bored student; this resulted in being held back a grade. In 1949, when Eastwood was 19, his parents and younger sister relocated to Seattle, and Clint spent a couple years working menial jobs in the Pacific Northwest. These included operating log broncs in Springfield, Oregon, with summer gigs lifeguarding in Renton, Washington. Returning to California in 1951, he did a stint at Fort Ord Military Reservation and later enrolled at Los Angeles City College, but dropped out after two semesters to pursue acting. During the mid-'50s he landed uncredited bit parts in such B-films as <a href="/title/tt0048554">Revenge of the Creature</a> (1955) and <a href="/title/tt0048696">Tarantula</a> (1955) while digging swimming pools and driving a garbage truck to supplement his income. In 1958, he landed his first consequential acting role in the long-running TV show <a href="/title/tt0052504">Rawhide</a> (1959) with <a href="/name/nm0281661">Eric Fleming</a>. Though only a secondary player for the first seven seasons, Clint was promoted to series star when Fleming departed--both literally and figuratively--in its final year, along the way becoming a recognizable face to television viewers around the country.<br /><br />Eastwood's big-screen breakthrough came as The Man with No Name in <a href="/name/nm0001466">Sergio Leone</a>'s trilogy of excellent spaghetti westerns: <a href="/title/tt0058461">A Fistful of Dollars</a> (1964), <a href="/title/tt0059578">For a Few Dollars More</a> (1965), and <a href="/title/tt0060196">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a> (1966). The movies were shown exclusively in Italy during their respective copyright years with <a href="/name/nm0758066">Enrico Maria Salerno</a> providing the voice for Clint's character, finally getting American distribution in 1967/68. As the last film racked up respectable grosses, Eastwood, 37, rose from low-level actor to sought-after commodity in just a matter of months. Again a success was the late-blooming star's first U.S.-made western, <a href="/title/tt0061747">Hang 'Em High</a> (1968). He followed that up with the lead role in <a href="/title/tt0062824">Coogan's Bluff</a> (1968) (the loose inspiration for the TV series <a href="/title/tt0065317">McCloud</a> (1970)), before playing second fiddle to <a href="/name/nm0000009">Richard Burton</a> in the World War II epic <a href="/title/tt0065207">Where Eagles Dare</a> (1968) and <a href="/name/nm0001511">Lee Marvin</a> in the bizarre musical <a href="/title/tt0064782">Paint Your Wagon</a> (1969). In <a href="/title/tt0065134">Two Mules for Sister Sara</a> (1970) and <a href="/title/tt0065938">Kelly's Heroes</a> (1970), Eastwood leaned in an experimental direction by combining tough-guy action with offbeat humor.<br /><br />1971 proved to be his busiest year in film. He starred as a sleazy Union soldier in <a href="/title/tt0066819">The Beguiled</a> (1971) to critical acclaim, and made his directorial debut with the classic erotic thriller <a href="/title/tt0067588">Play Misty for Me</a> (1971). His role as the hard edge police inspector in <a href="/title/tt0066999">Dirty Harry</a> (1971), meanwhile, boosted him to cultural icon status and helped popularize the loose-cannon cop genre. Eastwood put out a steady stream of entertaining movies thereafter: the westerns <a href="/title/tt0068768">Joe Kidd</a> (1972), <a href="/title/tt0068699">High Plains Drifter</a> (1973) and <a href="/title/tt0075029">The Outlaw Josey Wales</a> (1976) (his first of six onscreen collaborations with then live-in love <a href="/name/nm0516800">Sondra Locke</a>), the Dirty Harry sequels <a href="/title/tt0070355">Magnum Force</a> (1973) and <a href="/title/tt0074483">The Enforcer</a> (1976), the action-packed road adventures <a href="/title/tt0072288">Thunderbolt and Lightfoot</a> (1974) and <a href="/title/tt0076070">The Gauntlet</a> (1977), and the fact-based prison film <a href="/title/tt0079116">Escape from Alcatraz</a> (1979). He branched out into the comedy genre in 1978 with <a href="/title/tt0077523">Every Which Way but Loose</a> (1978), which became the biggest hit of his career up to that time; taking inflation into account, it still is. In short, <a href="/title/tt0072926">The Eiger Sanction</a> (1975) notwithstanding, the '70s were nonstop success for Clint.<br /><br />Eastwood kicked off the '80s with <a href="/title/tt0080377">Any Which Way You Can</a> (1980), the blockbuster sequel to Every Which Way but Loose. The fourth Dirty Harry film, <a href="/title/tt0086383">Sudden Impact</a> (1983), was the highest-grossing film of the franchise and spawned his trademark catchphrase: "Make my day." Clint also starred in <a href="/title/tt0080472">Bronco Billy</a> (1980), <a href="/title/tt0083943">Firefox</a> (1982), <a href="/title/tt0088272">Tightrope</a> (1984), <a href="/title/tt0087062">City Heat</a> (1984), <a href="/title/tt0089767">Pale Rider</a> (1985) and <a href="/title/tt0091187">Heartbreak Ridge</a> (1986), all of which were solid hits, with <a href="/title/tt0084088">Honkytonk Man</a> (1982) being his only commercial failure of the period. In 1988 he did his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie, <a href="/title/tt0094963">The Dead Pool</a> (1988). Although it was a success overall, it did not have the box office punch the previous films had. About this time, with outright bombs like <a href="/title/tt0098097">Pink Cadillac</a> (1989) and <a href="/title/tt0100514">The Rookie</a> (1990), it seemed Eastwood's star was declining as it never had before. He then started taking on low-key projects, directing <a href="/title/tt0094747">Bird</a> (1988), a biopic of <a href="/name/nm0662127">Charlie Parker</a> that earned him a Golden Globe, and starring in and directing <a href="/title/tt0100928">White Hunter Black Heart</a> (1990), an uneven, loose biopic of <a href="/name/nm0001379">John Huston</a> (both films had a limited release).<br /><br />Eastwood bounced back--big time--with his dark western <a href="/title/tt0105695">Unforgiven</a> (1992), which garnered the then 62-year-old his first ever Academy Award nomination (Best Actor), and an Oscar win for Best Director. Churning out a quick follow-up hit, he took on the secret service in <a href="/title/tt0107206">In the Line of Fire</a> (1993), then accepted second billing for the first time since 1970 in the interesting but poorly received <a href="/title/tt0107808">A Perfect World</a> (1993) with <a href="/name/nm0000126">Kevin Costner</a>. Next up was a love story, <a href="/title/tt0112579">The Bridges of Madison County</a> (1995), where Clint surprised audiences with a sensitive performance alongside none other than <a href="/name/nm0000658">Meryl Streep</a>. But it soon became apparent he was going backwards after his brief revival. Subsequent films were credible, but nothing really stuck out. <a href="/title/tt0118548">Absolute Power</a> (1997) and <a href="/title/tt0186566">Space Cowboys</a> (2000) did well enough, while <a href="/title/tt0139668">True Crime</a> (1999) and <a href="/title/tt0309377">Blood Work</a> (2002) were received badly, as was <a href="/title/tt0119668">Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</a> (1997), which he directed but didn't appear in.<br /><br />Eastwood surprised again in the mid-'00s, returning to the top of the A-list with <a href="/title/tt0405159">Million Dollar Baby</a> (2004). Also starring <a href="/name/nm0005476">Hilary Swank</a> and <a href="/name/nm0000151">Morgan Freeman</a>, the hugely successful drama won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Clint. He scored his second Best Actor nomination, too. Eastwood's next starring vehicle, <a href="/title/tt1205489">Gran Torino</a> (2008), earned almost $30 million in its opening weekend and was his highest grosser unadjusted for inflation. 2012 saw him in a rare lighthearted movie, <a href="/title/tt2083383">Trouble with the Curve</a> (2012), as well as a reality show, <a href="/title/tt2305717">Mrs. Eastwood &amp; Company</a> (2012). And between acting jobs, Clint chalked up a long and impressive list of credits behind the camera. He directed <a href="/title/tt0327056">Mystic River</a> (2003) (in which <a href="/name/nm0000576">Sean Penn</a> and <a href="/name/nm0000209">Tim Robbins</a> gave Oscar-winning performances), <a href="/title/tt0418689">Flags of Our Fathers</a> (2006), <a href="/title/tt0498380">Letters from Iwo Jima</a> (2006) (nominated for the Best Picture Oscar), <a href="/title/tt0824747">Changeling</a> (2008) (a vehicle for <a href="/name/nm0001401">Angelina Jolie</a>), <a href="/title/tt1057500">Invictus</a> (2009) (again with Freeman), <a href="/title/tt1212419">Hereafter</a> (2010), <a href="/title/tt1616195">J. Edgar</a> (2011), <a href="/title/tt1742044">Jersey Boys</a> (2014), <a href="/title/tt2179136">American Sniper</a> (2014) (2014's top box office champ), <a href="/title/tt3263904">Sully</a> (2016) (starring <a href="/name/nm0000158">Tom Hanks</a> as hero pilot <a href="/name/nm3314810">Chesley Sullenberger</a>) and <a href="/title/tt6802308">The 15:17 to Paris</a> (2018). Back on screens after a considerable absence, he played an unlikely drug courier in <a href="/title/tt7959026">The Mule</a> (2018), which reached the top of the box office with a nine-figure gross, then directed <a href="/title/tt3513548">Richard Jewell</a> (2019). At age 91, Eastwood made history as the oldest actor to star above the title in a movie with the release of <a href="/title/tt1924245">Cry Macho</a> (2021).<br /><br />Away from the limelight, Eastwood has led an aberrant existence and is described by biographer <a href="/name/nm0569292">Patrick McGilligan</a> as a cunning manipulator of the media. His convoluted slew of partners and children are now somewhat factually acknowledged, but for the first three decades of his celebrity, his personal life was kept top secret, and several of his families were left out of the official narrative. The actor refuses to disclose his exact number of offspring even to this day. He had a longtime relationship with similarly abstruse co-star Locke (who died aged 74 in 2018), and has fathered at least eight children by at least six different women in an unending string of liaisons, many of which overlapped. He has been married only twice, however -- with a mere three of his progeny coming from those unions.<br /><br />Eastwood has real estate holdings in Bel-Air, Carmel-by-the-Sea, Cassel (in northern California), Idaho's Sun Valley and Kihei, Hawaii.<br />

      Beginning in 1959, Eastwood was involved in a relationship with <a href="/name/nm0876651">Roxanne Tunis</a>, a regular extra/stuntwoman on <a href="/title/tt0052504">Rawhide</a> (1959). Their daughter <a href="/name/nm0247761">Kimber Eastwood</a> was born in 1964 as Kimber Tunis. Following Kimber's birth, Eastwood asked then-wife Maggie Johnson for a divorce. But within a matter of weeks afterward, Johnson fell very ill with hepatitis and had to be hospitalized. The pair reconciled, agreeing that it would be best if she turned a blind eye to his existing families (he also had a child in 1954 from a different affair), and in 1968, almost 15 years after they married, their first child together was born. Johnson was finally introduced to Tunis in 1972, outside Eastwood's presence, by a crew member on the set of <a href="/title/tt0069822">Breezy</a> (1973). The affair between Eastwood and Tunis is believed to have dissolved in the mid-seventies, around the time he and <a href="/name/nm0516800">Sondra Locke</a> got together. Tunis later appeared as an extra in <a href="/title/tt0077523">Every Which Way but Loose</a> (1978) as a member of the audience at LA's Palomino country-western club where Locke's character sings, but Eastwood didn't tell Locke about Kimber until 1983. She thought it was cruel that he admitted he was Kimber's father but never treated her accordingly.<br />

      Served as mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea for one term for the nominal salary of $300. Although press coverage was generally favorable, a small contingent insisted that Eastwood was a spoiled brat mayor and the town acted just like an indulgent parent. "We wanted to eliminate traffic and parking problems, not make more with hordes of tourists. He brought a lot of notoriety that we didn't need," said Jane Mayer, president of the Carmel Residents Association. "Some people thought he was charming, but I disagree. He didn't know anything about the issues. People are giving him credit for things that were on the table for years. He also hired a public relations woman and kept an unlisted phone number - he was totally inaccessible. I don't think that's being a good mayor." "It was a disaster," added former mayor Gunnar Norberg. "Eastwood turned a peaceful forest by the sea into Coney Island."

      According to author <a href="/name/nm0569292">Patrick McGilligan</a>, in July 1993 Eastwood was confronted with the claims of a woman in her late thirties, originally from Washington State, who had researched her adoption and ascertained that he was her biological father. After having his lawyers and business managers check her out, so the story goes, Eastwood agreed to have dinner with the woman, Laurie Murray, who was married to a rich man and was happy to guard her anonymity - she just wanted to meet him - and promised to stay in touch. In <a href="/title/tt6395942">Les grands reportages: L'album secret de Clint Eastwood</a> (2013), McGilligan stated on camera: "We don't know how many children Clint has had  with how many women." Besides Ms. Murray, since at least 2005 there is a rumor of unknown origin that Eastwood fathered a son named Lesly, born on 13 February 1959 to one Rosina Mary Glen.

      "Clint: The Life and Legend," a deeply unflattering biography by film historian <a href="/name/nm0569292">Patrick McGilligan</a>, was published in Great Britain in 1999, but did not make its way to the United States until 2002, having bounced around publishers for three years amid rumored threats from Eastwood's attorneys. Los Angeles Times critic <a href="/name/nm3417890">Allen Barra</a> called it "perhaps the most thoroughly demythologizing book yet written on modern Hollywood." On Christmas Eve 2002, Eastwood's lawyer <a href="/name/nm5695629">Marshall Grossman</a> filed a $10 million libel suit against McGilligan and St. Martin's Press in San Jose, California. Strangely enough, out of all the sordid stories in the book, the libel claim only covered three points, according to news reports: (1) That Eastwood once punched his first wife Maggie Johnson in the face; (2) That Eastwood is an atheist; (3) That Eastwood used a romantic relationship with an officer's daughter in order to avoid being sent overseas during the Korean conflict. The suit was settled in July 2004 without any public disclosure; McGilligan and the publisher admitted no wrongdoing and there was no penalty. A revised and updated version of "Clint" was published in 2015, with most of the original content intact. The three cited passages had been excised, and a few other modifications amounting to less than two pages were made. McGilligan says many of the things he reported in the first edition are now taken for granted, and one of the reasons Eastwood sued him was an obvious attempt to find out his sources.<br />

I must say, I'm not a negative person, but sometimes I wonder what kind of movies people are going to be making 10 years from now if they follow this trajectory. When I grew up there was such a variety of movies being made. You could go see <a href="/title/tt0034167">Sergeant York</a> (1941) or <a href="/title/tt0040795">Sitting Pretty</a> (1948) or <a href="/title/tt0034240">Sullivan's Travels</a> (1941), dozens of pictures, not to mention all the great B movies. Now, they're looking for whatever the last hit was. If it's <a href="/title/tt0317705">The Incredibles</a> (2004), they want 'The Double Incredibles.'

They said, "Well, it's a boxing movie." And I said, "It's not a boxing movie in my opinion. It's a father-daughter love story, and it's a lot of other things besides a boxing movie." They hemmed and hawed and finally said that if I wanted to take it, maybe they'd pay for the domestic rights only. After that, I'd be on my own. We took it to a couple of other studios, and they turned it down, much like <a href="/title/tt0327056">Mystic River</a> (2003) was turned down, the exact same pattern. People who kept calling and saying, "Come on, work with us on stuff." I'd give it to them, and they'd go, "Uh, we were thinking more in terms of Dirty Harry coming out of retirement." And who knows? Maybe when it comes out they'll be proven right.<br />

That kind of impossible effort was fun to portray, but I think it was interpreted as a pro-police point of view, as a kind of rightist heroism, at a time in American history when police officers were looked down on as "pigs", as very oppressive people - I'm sure there are some who are, and a lot who aren't.

      You have to trust your instincts. There's a moment when an actor has it, and he knows it. Behind the camera you can feel the moment even more clearly.

      [on <a href="/name/nm0001379">John Huston</a>] It's another aspect of the character that pleased me: he was interested in other things besides his art. He liked women, gambling, living the high life. He could have a life parallel to his work. I could identify with this type of behavior. But, because of this very fact, he became attracted more and more by other things, so that what interested him in life moved him away from his art to the point that he nearly lived a tragedy. And the tragedy brings him back to reality. If you study Huston's life, you realize that at the age of nineteen he thought he didn't have long to live because of a heart defect a doctor has notified him of as a result of a misdiagnosis. It drove him to elaborate a personal philosophy according to which he would profit from life to the maximum. He didn't take care of himself - he was a confirmed smoker, a heavy drinker - and yet he lived to be more than eighty. <a href="/name/nm0000056">Paul Newman</a> spoke to me about him when we were acting at the same time, each in a different movie, in Tucson, Arizona. He was starring in <a href="/title/tt0068853">The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean</a> (1972) and I was doing <a href="/title/tt0068768">Joe Kidd</a> (1972) with <a href="/name/nm0836328">John Sturges</a>. Huston drank martinis and smoked cigars all night long, slept from one o'clock to four o'clock in the morning because he was an insomniac, did everything he shouldn't do to live to be old, and yet he died at a very great age!

      I also wonder how I got this far in life. Growing up, I never knew what I wanted to do. I was not a terribly good student or a very vivacious, outgoing person. I was just kind of a backward kid. I grew up in various little towns and ended up in Oakland, California, going to a trade school. I didn't want to be an actor, because I thought an actor had to be an extrovert - somebody who loved to tell jokes and talk and be a raconteur. And I was something of an introvert. My mother used to say: "You have a little angel on your shoulder." I guess she was surprised I grew up at all, never mind that I got to where I am.

      Every movie I make teaches me something, and that's why I keep making them. I'm at that stage of life when I could probably stop and just hit golf balls. But in filming these two movies about Iwo Jima, I learnt about war and about character. I also learnt a lot about myself.<br />
    </div>
    <div class="soda odd">
      I was a teenager when the battle of Iwo Jima took place. I remember hearing about the bond drive and the need to maintain the war effort. Back then, people had just come through 10 years of a Depression, and they were used to working for everything. I still have an image of someone coming to our house when I was about six years old, offering to cut and stack the wood in our back yard if my mother would make him a sandwich.<br />

    <div class="soda even">
      The Americans who went to Iwo Jima knew it would be a tough fight, but they always believed they'd win. The Japanese were told they wouldn't come home - they were being sent to die for the Emperor. People have made a lot out of that very different cultural approach. But as I got into the storytelling for the two movies [<a href="/title/tt0418689">Flags of Our Fathers</a> (2006) and <a href="/title/tt0498380">Letters from Iwo Jima</a> (2006)], I realised that the 19-year-olds from both sides had the same fears. They all wrote poignant letters home saying: "I don't want to die." They were all going through the same thing, despite the cultural differences.<br />
    </div>
    <div class="soda odd">
      I guess if you see both of the movies [<a href="/title/tt0418689">Flags of Our Fathers</a> (2006) and <a href="/title/tt0498380">Letters from Iwo Jima</a> (2006)] together, they sum up as an antiwar film. Whether it's about territory or religion, war is horrifyingly and depressingly archaic. But I didn't set out to make a war movie. I cared about those three fellows - Bradley, Hayes and Gagnon [<a href="/name/nm0103287">John H. Bradley</a>, <a href="/name/nm0371050">Ira H. Hayes</a>, <a href="/name/nm0301035">Rene A.

      "Macho" was a fashionable word in the 1980s. Everybody was kind of into it, what's macho and what isn't macho. I really don't know what macho is. I never have understood. Does it mean somebody who swaggers around exuding testosterone? And kicks the gate open and runs sprints up and down the street? Or does handsprings or whatever? Or is macho a quiet thing based on your security. I remember shaking hands with <a href="/name/nm0545698">Rocky Marciano</a>. He was gentle, he didn't squeeze your hand. And he had a high voice. But he could knock people around, it was a given. That's macho. <a href="/name/nm0000738">Muhammad Ali</a> is the same. If you talked with him in his younger years, he spoke gently.

      I was tired of playing the nice, clean-cut cowboy in <a href="/title/tt0052504">Rawhide</a> (1959), I wanted something earthier. Something different from the old-fashioned Western. You know: Hero rides in, very stalwart, with white hat, man's beating a horse, hero jumps off, punches man, schoolmarm walks down the street, sees this situation going on, slight conflict with schoolmarm, but not too much. You know schoolmarm and hero will be together in exactly 10 more reels, if you care to sit around and wait, and you know the man beast horse with eventually get comeuppance from hero this guy bushwhacks him in reel nine. But [<a href="/title/tt0058461">A Fistful of Dollars</a> (1964)] was different; it definitely had satiric overtones.
